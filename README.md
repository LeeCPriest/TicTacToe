# TicTacToe

Simple console based Tic Tac Toe game

This project consists of 3 classes:
- 'Board' consists of the game board attribute as well as several methods to initialize, update and draw the board, as well as evaluate when the game has ended
- The 'Player' class contains the player character enumeration (i.e. X and O) as well as a method to retrieve the input move from the user
- The 'Program' class initializes the above objects and executes the gameplay using nested while loops
